# CRYPTOGRAPHY

An Elm application that can encode Caesar, Viginere and Hash cyphers, and can decode Caesar and Viginere cyphers.

My previous cryptography assignment was on python but I'm definitely not getting 100% on that so I'm making one in elm lol. Wish me luck.

## Update

Ayy this project went pretty well! I think I'm kinda proud of it (it was my first Elm project) and I would say I didn't do such a bad job at it lol.

## How it works

To try it out, just open the HTML file, which contains the compiled elm code (just a bunch of javascript code). Tweaking the code requires a bit more work and [this documentation](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) should help.
